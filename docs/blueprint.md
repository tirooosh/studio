- Background color: A light, off-white (#F5F5DC) provides a gentle contrast and emulates the feeling of old books.

- Use file-type icons/labels (e.g., ðŸ“„ PDF, ðŸ“˜ EPUB) for clear visual differentiation.
- Employ a clear and intuitive layout optimized for comfortable reading, easy navigation, and seamless access to all key features.
- Use subtle, unobtrusive animations to enhance user experience, such as smooth transitions when opening books, highlighting text, or navigating chapters.
